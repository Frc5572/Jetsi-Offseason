 * Grouping signals and refreshing them together ensures that all sampled values share the same
 * synchronization fence, minimizing timestamp skew between related measurements.
 *

 * Signals are maintained in separate groups depending on whether they are sourced from a CANivore
 * bus or the roboRIO CAN bus, as Phoenix requires refresh calls to be performed per bus.
